# CPlusPlus-Program
In this project I had to make a clock program that had a 12 hour and 24 hour clock outputted on the screen with an options menu to add an hour, min, or sec. 
I feel like I did well at creating a clock program that output the necessary elements.
I feel like I could have improved the code by adding a loop for the times or even a switch statement and figuring out how to format the am and pm correctly. This would have helped with the length of the code and readability.
The pieces of code I found most challenging were probably just the output of the code. The way it was supposed to look outputted on the screen. That took me a long time to figure out spacing. I will add all tools and resources I can to help me better my coding.
I think a lot of the skills I used will be transferrable but like I said I would rather use loops and switch statements to cut down on the length of code.
I made this program maintanable readable and addaptable by using coding skills I required from zybooks and sites like reddit and stock overflow for help when I got stuck. I also used inline comments for readability.
